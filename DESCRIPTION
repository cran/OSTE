Description: Function for growing survival trees ensemble ('Naz Gul', 'Nosheen Faiz', 'Dan Brawn', 'Rafal Kulakowski', 'Zardad Khan', and 'Berthold Lausen' (2020) <arXiv:2005.09043>) is given. 
             The trees are grown by the method of random survival forest ('Marvin Wright', 'Andreas Ziegler' (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>). 
             The survival trees grown are assessed for both individual and collective performances. 
             The ensemble can give promising results on fewer survival trees selected in the final ensemble.
